# 📝 NLP Projects - Sentiment Analysis & Resume Screening  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains **three major NLP projects**, each applying different techniques in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:  
1. **Amazon Alexa Sentiment Analysis (Machine Learning Approach)**  
2. **Amazon Alexa Sentiment Analysis (Fine-Tuned BERT Model)**  
3. **AI-Powered Resume Screener (NLP & ML-Based Ranking System)**  

Each project involves **text preprocessing, vectorization, and machine learning models** to analyze, classify, and extract insights from textual data.
